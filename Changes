0.0.7 - Fri Feb  2 19:03:29 IST 2007
    - moved the tree script under the examples directory.
    - added the LICENSE section to the POD.
    - added t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t and made sure the module
      has full POD coverage.
    - added a Build.PL build script to generate a better META.yml file.
    - all of these are Kwalitee improvements.
      ( http://cpants.perl.org/dist/File-Find-Object )
    - Added some links to the main POD documentation for similar modules
      and for the Perl Advent article.

0.0.6 - Tue Nov 28 15:49:23 IST 2006
    - Added the following new interface methods:
        - set_traverse_to
        - get_traverse_to
        - get_current_node_files_list
        - prune
    - Some changes to the internals to accomodate for them.

0.0.5 - Sun Sep  3 23:22:36 IDT 2006
    - Eliminated the F-F-O-internal isa F-F-O relationship.
    - Created accessors for everything - now based on Class::Accessor
    - F-F-O-internal is now named File::Find::Object::PathComponent
    - Some smaller refactorings.

0.0.4 - Wed Aug 23 00:31:39 IDT 2006
    - Eliminated circular references. (Hopefully)
        - Still have an isa relationship between File::Find::Object and
        File::Find::Object::internal, which is what handles each recursed to
        directory.
    - Created some accessor functions instead of direct hash accesses.

0.0.3 - Fri Jul 14 14:25:42 IDT 2006
    - Fixed some language problems in the POD.
    - Added the Changes file.
    - Changed the license to GPL/Artistic/Artistic-2.0
    - Placed the .pm files inside lib.
    - Added the TreeCreate module under t/lib (with appropriate tests) to test 
    the main module.
    - Made the default test order lexicographical, and predictable. In the 
    process, eliminated keeping the directory handles, and possibly the fact 
    that they are kept open.
    - Fixed a bug where circular references prevented the module from being
    destroyed.
